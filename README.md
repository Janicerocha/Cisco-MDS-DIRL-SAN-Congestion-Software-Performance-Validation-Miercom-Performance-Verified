I was the lead engineer for this project which focused on performance validation for the Cisco MDs 9000 Series which features their DIRL software. 
Please see the full detailed report. 

Storage Area Networks (SAN) are dedicated high-speed networks that allow devices to access large amounts of data. As high-performance all-flash and NVMe storage arrays are connected to Fibre Channel SANs, the issue of congestion and slow drain is becoming a bigger problem, resulting in the need for enhanced techniques to identify, correct and prevent SAN congestion.

The CiscoÂ® MDS 9000 Series directors and switches provide a solution to correct this problem with its Dynamic Ingress Rate Limiting (DIRL) software, a new innovation that identifies and prevents SAN congestion. SAN congestion caused by slow drain and over-utilization, is prevented by the MDS DIRL software with no impact on the target device and other connected devices.
